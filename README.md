## Description

Family historians are often frustrated with the effort it takes to share the family history with members everywhere, especially old photos. 

PhotoScribe solves this problem by allowing users to create photo albums that include pictures with detailed text that are then simply shared by forwarding an email link.  

With PhotoScribe, the photo family history is stored in one safe, convenient, accessible place and is easily passed along to younger generations.
